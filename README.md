# Soufian Rouas pre-course project: Monkey D. Luffy Tribute Page

I chose to make a tribute page on the main character from *'One Piece'* because he's a character I like, from a show I enjoy - and because I was little lost on who to do it on :sweat_smile:.

I built this while learning (still currently learning) HTML & CSS Basics, so it was good to practice my new skills and start to get used to coding in these languages. 

Here are my top 5 takeaways and reflextions from these early experiences in coding and learning HTML & CSS:
1. I won't remember everything (whether its a rule or tag etc.), but as long as I understand it, I can ask Google and quickly get an answer/ remind myself and then use it.
2. Sometimes it won't make sense, watching or reading how to do something until I try it and run it myself.
3. Don't just study and wait to finish studying everything before practicing, __while studying__ - go and practice typing and running the code and build something. It'll help solidify those new skills I just learnt. And even after this, I may forget - but as stated earlier I can flick back on notes or have a quick google!
4. When things mess up, don't get frustrated... just read through your code and see if you made a mistake/forgot to type something and refer to notes.
5. Don't get lost when looking at all the words and special characters, just take it one line at a time.

Thank you for reading and checking out my tribute page!
